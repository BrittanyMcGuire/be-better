# No Sunday Scaries in Tech

Hi there, I'm [Brittany](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanymcguire/) 👋.

I am a tech focused recruiter in Chicago ★★★★ that has been annoying anyone who slings code or pays their bills from the CPG world for over the last 10 years.

### But Brittany, you're not a developer. What the hell are you doing here?

My candidates live here 👩‍💻 Why would you want another recruiter spamming your LinkedIn inbox you don’t check anyways? I want to see what potential candidates for my tech teams are interested in, working on, and looking for. I play with people’s lives for a living - I take that seriously.

### Okay, but whats in it for me?

Throughout my profile you will see that I share tips for those looking for new roles, want to prep for interviews better, and put information at your fingertips on how you can land that dream job you're looking at. It may not be with me, but it’s all about karma.

👉 This is a work in progress. I'm always learning and adding new things so either I can remember them, or you can use them. I didn't find all this myself and heartfully thank all those in the recruitment community that provided help along the way. 💛
