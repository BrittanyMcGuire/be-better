# No Sunday Scaries in Tech

Hi there, I'm [Brittany](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brittanymcguire/) 👋.

I am a tech-focused recruiter in Chicago ★★★★ that has been annoying anyone who slings code or pays their bills from the CPG world for over the last ten years.

### But Brittany, you're not a developer. What the hell are you doing here?

My candidates live here 👩‍💻 Why would you want another recruiter spamming your LinkedIn inbox that you don't check anyway? I want to see what potential candidates for my tech teams are interested in, working on, and looking for. This is also a different place to get to learn about me as a human. I play with people's lives for a living - I take that seriously. 

### Okay, but what's in it for me?

Throughout my profile, you see that I share tips for those looking for new roles, want to prep for interviews, and information on how to land that dream job. It may not be with me, but it's all about karma.

👉 This is a work in progress. I'm always learning and adding new things, so either I can remember them, or you can use them. I didn't find all this myself, and I thank all those in the recruitment community that provided help along the way. 💛
